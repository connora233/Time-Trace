This is an iOS game made by Ashley Granitto and Connor Anderson. The goal of the game is to trace as many lines as
possible without veering off of the lines, lifting your finger, or having the lines disappear before you reach the end.
Within our game, there three different themes for the user to choose from: Rainbow, Space, and Sunset. Each of these themes
comes with unique line colors and a custom background.
